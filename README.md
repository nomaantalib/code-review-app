# CodeReviewAI - Authentication Fix

This document explains the fixes implemented to resolve the "An error occurred. Please try again" error during login or signup.

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Backend Authentication Controllers

- Improved error handling in `backend/src/controllers/auth.controllers.js`
- Added input validation for required fields
- Added more specific error messages for different error types
- Added better error logging

### 2. Frontend Login and Signup Components

- Improved error handling in `frontend/src/components/Auth/Login.jsx` and `frontend/src/components/Auth/Signup.jsx`
- Added more specific error messages based on HTTP status codes
- Added better handling for network errors

### 3. Database Connection

- Added validation for required environment variables in `backend/src/config/db.js`
- Added better error messages for database connection issues

### 4. Environment Variable Validation

- Added validation for required environment variables in `backend/src/app.js`
- Added check for JWT_SECRET in authentication middleware

### 5. User Model Improvements

- Added better validation for user input in `backend/src/models/User.js`
- Improved password handling and comparison

### 6. Authentication Middleware

- Added better error handling for JWT verification in `backend/src/middleware/auth.middleware.js`
- Added validation for required JWT_SECRET environment variable

### 7. Authentication Routes

- Added error handling middleware in `backend/src/routes/auth.routes.js`

## Required Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory with the following variables:

```
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
PORT=3000
```

## Setup Instructions

1. Create a MongoDB database (you can use MongoDB Atlas for a cloud database)
2. Set up the required environment variables as shown above
3. Install backend dependencies: `cd backend && npm install`
4. Install frontend dependencies: `cd frontend && npm install`
5. Start the backend server: `cd backend && npm run dev`
6. Start the frontend: `cd frontend && npm run dev`

## Common Issues and Solutions

### "An error occurred. Please try again"

This error typically occurs when:

1. Environment variables are not properly configured
2. Database connection is failing
3. Network issues between frontend and backend

### Database Connection Issues

Ensure your MONGODB_URI is correctly configured and the database is accessible.

### JWT Secret Issues

Ensure JWT_SECRET is set in your environment variables.

## Testing the Fix

1. Try to register a new user with valid credentials
2. Try to login with existing user credentials
3. Check browser console and backend terminal for any error messages
4. Verify that environment variables are properly set

If you continue to experience issues, check the backend terminal for detailed error messages.
