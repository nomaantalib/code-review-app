# Fix Reload Flicker Issue - Implementation Complete

## Changes Made:

1. ✅ Added `authLoading` state to track authentication status in App.jsx
2. ✅ Modified useEffect to properly handle loading state transitions
3. ✅ Updated route rendering to wait for auth check completion before rendering routes
4. ✅ Added loading indicator with CSS styling during authentication check

## Solution Summary:

The flicker issue was caused by the asynchronous nature of the authentication check. When the page reloaded:

- The `user` state was initially `null`
- React Router immediately redirected to `/login`
- The authentication check completed later and set the user, but the redirect had already happened

## Fix Implementation:

- Added `authLoading` state that starts as `true`
- The app now shows a loading indicator while checking authentication
- Routes are only rendered after the auth check completes (`authLoading` becomes `false`)
- This prevents the temporary redirect to login page during reload

## Files Modified:

- `frontend/src/App.jsx` - Added loading state and conditional rendering
- `frontend/src/App.css` - Added styles for auth loading indicator

The fix ensures that logged-in users will stay on the home page/code review interface when reloading, eliminating the login page flicker.
